# Solvent Extraction (SX)

Conceptual notes on copper solvent extraction, including phase ratios
and extraction–stripping logic.

## PLS Definition to SX Circuit

The pregnant leach solution (PLS) generated from the leaching stage
forms the feed to the solvent extraction circuit.

Based on the upstream leaching design:
- Dissolved copper: 241 kg Cu/h

A target PLS copper concentration of 6 g/L was selected,
which is typical for agitated ferric leaching systems.

This results in:
- PLS flowrate to SX: ~40 m³/h

Typical PLS composition to SX:
- Cu²⁺: 6 g/L
- Free H₂SO₄: 5–10 g/L
- Total Fe: 1–3 g/L
- Temperature: 30–40 °C

These parameters form the design basis for SX mixer–settler sizing.
