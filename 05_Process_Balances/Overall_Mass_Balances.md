# Overall Copper Mass Balance (Conceptual)

## Basis
- Copper cathode production: 50 t/day
- Overall copper recovery (ore to cathode): assumed

## Recovery Assumptions
- Beneficiation recovery: 85%
- Leaching recovery: 90%
- SX–EW recovery: 98%

## Overall Recovery
Overall copper recovery is estimated as:

Overall recovery = 0.85 × 0.90 × 0.98 ≈ 75%

## Implication
Approximately 75% of copper contained in the ore feed
is recovered as final copper cathode.

## Ore Throughput Estimation

Based on the selected design basis:

- Copper cathode production: 50 t/day
- Overall copper recovery: 75%
- Ore grade: 1.0% Cu

The required copper in ore feed is:

Required Cu in ore = 50 / 0.75 ≈ 66.7 t Cu/day

The corresponding ore throughput is estimated as:

Ore throughput = 66.7 / 0.01 ≈ 6,670 t ore/day

## Beneficiation Product to Leaching

Based on beneficiation performance:

- Ore throughput: 6,670 t/day
- Ore grade: 1.0% Cu
- Beneficiation copper recovery: 85%
- Concentrate grade: 25% Cu

Copper reporting to concentrate:

Cu in concentrate = 66.7 × 0.85 ≈ 56.7 t Cu/day

Corresponding concentrate mass flow to leaching:

Concentrate throughput = 56.7 / 0.25 ≈ 227 t/day
