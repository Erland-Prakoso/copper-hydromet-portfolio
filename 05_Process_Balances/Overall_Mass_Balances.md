# Overall Copper Mass Balance (Conceptual)

## Basis
- Copper cathode production: 50 t/day
- Overall copper recovery (ore to cathode): assumed

## Recovery Assumptions
- Beneficiation recovery: 85%
- Leaching recovery: 90%
- SX–EW recovery: 98%

## Overall Recovery
Overall copper recovery is estimated as:

Overall recovery = 0.85 × 0.90 × 0.98 ≈ 75%

## Implication
Approximately 75% of copper contained in the ore feed
is recovered as final copper cathode.
