# Overall Copper Process – Design Basis

## Objective
To define a conceptual end-to-end process for copper extraction
from ore through hydrometallurgical processing.

## Process Route
- Ore beneficiation to upgrade copper grade
- Acid leaching for copper dissolution
- Solvent extraction for copper concentration and purification
- Electrowinning for final copper cathode production

## Design Philosophy
- First-principle based calculations
- Typical industry operating ranges
- Steady-state conceptual operation
