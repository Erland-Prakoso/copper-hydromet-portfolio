# Overall Copper Process – Design Basis

## Objective
To define a conceptual end-to-end process for copper extraction
from ore through hydrometallurgical processing.

## Process Route
- Ore beneficiation to upgrade copper grade
- Acid leaching for copper dissolution
- Solvent extraction for copper concentration and purification
- Electrowinning for final copper cathode production

## Design Philosophy
- First-principle based calculations
- Typical industry operating ranges
- Steady-state conceptual operation

## Design Capacity Basis
The process is designed based on a target copper cathode production rate.
This capacity is selected to represent a small-scale hydrometallurgical operation.

- Target copper cathode production: 50 t Cu/day
- Operating time: 24 hours/day
- Design basis: steady-state operation

## Basis of Calculation
All mass balance calculations are normalized to:
- 1 day of operation
- Average ore feed composition

## Ore Grade Assumption
The copper ore feed is assumed to have an average copper grade of:

- Copper grade: 1.0% Cu (by weight)

This grade is representative of a low-to-medium grade copper ore
commonly treated using beneficiation followed by hydrometallurgical processing.

## Concentrate Grade Assumption
The beneficiation circuit is assumed to produce a copper concentrate with:

- Copper grade in concentrate: 25% Cu (by weight)

This grade is typical for flotation concentrates intended for
downstream hydrometallurgical treatment.
