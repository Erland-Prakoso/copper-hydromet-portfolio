# copper-hydromet-portfolio
Metallurgy portfolio focusing on copper processing from beneficiation to hydrometallurgical extraction, including leaching, SX–EW, and preliminary process design.

## Scope of Work
This repository covers selected technical topics in copper process metallurgy,
including but not limited to:
- Ore beneficiation (crushing, grinding, and concentration overview)
- Acid leaching of copper ores
- Solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX–EW)
- Process mass balance and basic energy considerations
- Preliminary design basis for selected process equipment

## Approach
All works are developed using first-principle analysis combined with
typical industry practices and realistic engineering assumptions.

## Disclaimer
This repository is intended for educational and preliminary engineering purposes only.
It does not represent a complete or construction-ready process design.
