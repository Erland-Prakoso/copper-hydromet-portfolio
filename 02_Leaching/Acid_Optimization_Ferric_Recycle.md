# Acid Consumption Optimization Using Ferric Recycle

## Concept
In practical chalcopyrite leaching systems, ferric iron (Fe³⁺)
acts as the primary oxidant for copper dissolution.
Sulfuric acid is mainly required for pH control, gangue reactions,
and iron redox balance rather than direct copper dissolution.

## Key Reactions

Ferric leaching:
CuFeS₂ + 4 Fe³⁺ → Cu²⁺ + 5 Fe²⁺ + 2 S⁰

Ferric regeneration:
4 Fe²⁺ + O₂ + 4 H⁺ → 4 Fe³⁺ + 2 H₂O

## Practical Acid Consumption Basis
Based on industry practice for concentrate leaching,
typical sulfuric acid consumption ranges from
30–60 kg H₂SO₄ per tonne of concentrate.

For preliminary design, the following assumption is adopted:
- Acid consumption: 50 kg H₂SO₄ / t concentrate

## Estimated Acid Requirement

Concentrate throughput: 227 t/day

Estimated acid consumption:
227 × 50 ≈ 11.4 t H₂SO₄/day

## Remarks
This optimized acid requirement is significantly lower
than the theoretical stoichiometric value and reflects
the benefit of ferric recycle in sulfide leaching systems.
