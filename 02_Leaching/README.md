# Leaching

## Objective
To dissolve copper from the beneficiated ore or concentrate
into an aqueous solution for downstream recovery.

## Leaching Approach
- Acid leaching using sulfuric acid
- Oxidative conditions depending on copper mineralogy
- Controlled temperature and residence time

## Key Reactions (Conceptual)
- Copper oxide dissolution in acidic media
- Oxidation of copper sulfides in the presence of oxidants

## Design Considerations
- Acid consumption
- Oxidant requirement
- Solid–liquid separation efficiency

## Leach Feed Characteristics
The leaching circuit is designed to treat a copper concentrate
produced from beneficiation, rather than run-of-mine ore.

Based on preliminary mass balance:
- Concentrate throughput: ~227 t/day
- Copper grade in concentrate: ~25% Cu

This significantly reduces leach reactor size and
acid consumption compared to direct ore leaching.

## Mineralogical Assumption
For stoichiometric leaching calculations, copper in the concentrate
is assumed to be primarily present as chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂).

This assumption is commonly used for preliminary hydrometallurgical
design of copper flotation concentrates.
