# Leaching

## Objective
To dissolve copper from the beneficiated ore or concentrate
into an aqueous solution for downstream recovery.

## Leaching Approach
- Acid leaching using sulfuric acid
- Oxidative conditions depending on copper mineralogy
- Controlled temperature and residence time

## Key Reactions (Conceptual)
- Copper oxide dissolution in acidic media
- Oxidation of copper sulfides in the presence of oxidants

## Design Considerations
- Acid consumption
- Oxidant requirement
- Solid–liquid separation efficiency
