# Leaching

## Objective
To dissolve copper from the beneficiated ore or concentrate
into an aqueous solution for downstream recovery.

## Leaching Approach
- Acid leaching using sulfuric acid
- Oxidative conditions depending on copper mineralogy
- Controlled temperature and residence time

## Key Reactions (Conceptual)
- Copper oxide dissolution in acidic media
- Oxidation of copper sulfides in the presence of oxidants

## Design Considerations
- Acid consumption
- Oxidant requirement
- Solid–liquid separation efficiency

## Leach Feed Characteristics
The leaching circuit is designed to treat a copper concentrate
produced from beneficiation, rather than run-of-mine ore.

Based on preliminary mass balance:
- Concentrate throughput: ~227 t/day
- Copper grade in concentrate: ~25% Cu

This significantly reduces leach reactor size and
acid consumption compared to direct ore leaching.

## Mineralogical Assumption
For stoichiometric leaching calculations, copper in the concentrate
is assumed to be primarily present as chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂).

This assumption is commonly used for preliminary hydrometallurgical
design of copper flotation concentrates.

## Overall Leaching Reaction (Simplified)

CuFeS₂ + 4 H₂SO₄ + O₂ → CuSO₄ + FeSO₄ + 4 H₂O + 2 S⁰

This overall reaction is used for preliminary estimation
of acid and oxidant requirements.

## Ferric Regeneration Oxygen Demand

Ferric ions reduced during chalcopyrite leaching must be regenerated
to maintain oxidative leaching conditions.

Based on the reaction:
4Fe²⁺ + O₂ + 4H⁺ → 4Fe³⁺ + 2H₂O

The oxygen demand is directly proportional to the amount of copper leached.

For a copper dissolution rate of 241 kg/h:
- Ferric reduced: 15.16 kmol Fe³⁺/h
- Oxygen required: 3.79 kmol O₂/h
- Equivalent to ~85 Nm³ O₂/h
- Or ~404 Nm³ air/h at 21% O₂

This oxygen requirement governs air blower sizing
and gas–liquid mass transfer design.
