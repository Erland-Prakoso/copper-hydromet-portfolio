# Electrowinning (EW)

Preliminary electrowinning considerations including current density,
cell voltage, and energy usage.

## Stripping and EW Feed Definition

Copper loaded in the organic phase is transferred to the
electrolyte during the stripping stage.

Design assumptions:
- Stripping efficiency: 98%
- Target rich electrolyte copper concentration: 50 g/L

Copper transferred to EW:
- ~223 kg Cu/h

This results in a rich electrolyte flowrate of approximately
4.5 m³/h to the electrowinning circuit.

Typical EW feed composition:
- Cu²⁺: 45–55 g/L
- H₂SO₄: 150–180 g/L
- Fe total: < 0.1 g/L
- Temperature: 45–55 °C

## Copper Cathode Production Rate

Copper reporting to the electrowinning circuit
was estimated at approximately 223 kg Cu/h.

Assuming a current efficiency of 95%,
the resulting copper cathode production rate is:

- ~212 kg Cu/h

With a plant availability of 90%,
this corresponds to an annual production of:

- ~1,670 t Cu cathode per year

These figures are consistent with a small-scale
hydrometallurgical SX–EW operation.

## Electrowinning Cell Sizing

Based on a copper cathode production rate of 212 kg Cu/h
and a current efficiency of 95%, the total electrowinning
current requirement was estimated at approximately 190 kA.

Assuming a current density of 300 A/m²,
the total required cathode area is approximately 630 m².

Using standard copper cathodes with an effective area
of ~2.0 m² per plate, this corresponds to approximately
320 cathodes.

With an average of 25 cathodes per cell,
the electrowinning circuit consists of approximately
13 EW cells operating in parallel.

## Electrowinning Power Consumption

The electrowinning circuit operates at a total current
of approximately 190 kA.

Assuming an average cell voltage of 2.1 V
and 13 cells connected electrically in series,
the total operating voltage is approximately 27 V.

This results in an electrowinning power demand of:
- ~5.1 MW

Based on a copper cathode production rate of
212 kg Cu/h, the specific power consumption is:
- ~24 kWh/kg Cu

This value is within the typical industrial range
for copper electrowinning operations.
