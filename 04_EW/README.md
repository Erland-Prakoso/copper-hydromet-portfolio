# Electrowinning (EW)

Preliminary electrowinning considerations including current density,
cell voltage, and energy usage.

## Stripping and EW Feed Definition

Copper loaded in the organic phase is transferred to the
electrolyte during the stripping stage.

Design assumptions:
- Stripping efficiency: 98%
- Target rich electrolyte copper concentration: 50 g/L

Copper transferred to EW:
- ~223 kg Cu/h

This results in a rich electrolyte flowrate of approximately
4.5 m³/h to the electrowinning circuit.

Typical EW feed composition:
- Cu²⁺: 45–55 g/L
- H₂SO₄: 150–180 g/L
- Fe total: < 0.1 g/L
- Temperature: 45–55 °C
