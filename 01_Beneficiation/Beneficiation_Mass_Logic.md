# Beneficiation Mass Flow Logic

Based on the overall copper recovery target,
the beneficiation stage is assumed to upgrade the ore
by rejecting a significant portion of gangue minerals.

The upgraded concentrate stream reduces the mass flow
to the leaching circuit while maintaining high copper recovery.

Detailed mass flow calculations will be developed
after defining ore grade and concentrate grade assumptions.

Based on the estimated ore throughput of approximately
6,670 t/day, beneficiation is required to reduce the solid
mass flow reporting to leaching while maintaining high copper recovery.

The beneficiation stage therefore plays a critical role in
minimizing leach reactor size and acid consumption.
