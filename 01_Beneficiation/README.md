# Beneficiation

## Objective
To upgrade copper ore grade prior to hydrometallurgical processing,
thereby improving leaching efficiency and reducing reagent consumption.

## Typical Unit Operations
The beneficiation stage may include:
- Crushing and grinding to liberate copper-bearing minerals
- Classification to control particle size distribution
- Concentration (e.g. flotation) to reject gangue minerals

## Role in Hydrometallurgical Route
Beneficiation reduces the mass flow reporting to leaching,
which results in:
- Lower acid consumption
- Smaller leach reactor volumes
- Improved overall process economics

## Design Considerations
- Degree of liberation versus grinding energy
- Copper recovery versus concentrate grade
- Compatibility of concentrate mineralogy with downstream leaching
